title: The Battle for Las Vegas
---

- Describes the consolidation of the Las Vegas Strip by MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment, who collectively own and/or operate more than half of the hotel-casinos
- The ownership and management of the hotel-casinos has been separated
- A REIT, VICI Properties was spun out of Caesars Entertainment in 2017. In 2022, VICI bought MGM Growth Properties which was spun MGM Resorts International in 2015

Why did I add this?
- Interesting to see the consolidation of the Vegas Strip and the separation of ownership and management of casinos
- Reminded me of The Caesars Palace Coup by Max Frumes and Sujeet Indap recommended by [Jay Vasantharajah](https://x.com/jayvas/status/1396455782690983938?s=20)
