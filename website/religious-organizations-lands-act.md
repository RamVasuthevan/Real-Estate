Before 2009, the Religious Organizations' Lands Act prevented religious organizations from leasing lands for more than 40 years. In 2008, the [St. Andrew' s United Church (Toronto) Act, 2008, S.O. 2008, c. Pr2 - Bill Pr3](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/pr08002) makes an expection for St. Andrew’s Congregation of The United Church of Canada at Toronto for 121 Bloor Street East
