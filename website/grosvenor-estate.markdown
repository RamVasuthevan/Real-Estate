title: Grosvenor Estate

Why I found this interesting?:
- The Grosvenor Estate, which owns the Grosvenor Group is owned by the Duke of Westminster
-  Upon his father's death in August 2016, the Duke inherited, as well as the peerages, a wealth then estimated at £9 billion, with considerable trust funds for his sisters.[7] This wealth is held in a trust, of which the 7th Duke of Westminster, as he became, is a beneficial owner but not the legal owner—an arrangement that received considerable media attention, owing to the inheritance tax exemption it confers. — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grosvenor,_7th_Duke_of_Westminster#:~:text=Upon%20his%20father's,exemption%20it%20confers.%5B)
