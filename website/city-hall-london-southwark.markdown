title: City Hall, London (Southwark)
---

- Technically, it was not a city hall but the headquarters headquarters of the mayor of the Greater London Authority 
- The More London Complex it was a part of was sold by London Bridge Holdings, a Bahamas-based company led by Armenian businessman Dikran Izmirlian, to St Martins, the UK-based property investment vehicle of the Kuwaiti government, for £1.7B 

Why did I add this?
- You don't often see cities not owning their City Hall
